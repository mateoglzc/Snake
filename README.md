# Snake Game

We are all familiar with the classic game "Snake", in which you control a little snake that gets bigger and bigger every time it eats. 

This is a version of the game 'Snake' made in python using the Pygame library. With this I'm also working on a deep learning AI model that will hopefully learn to play the game.

## Normal Snake

Let's get started with the normal Snake game. üòÅ

### **Installing it**

To play the game we first need to download it.

If you would only like to play the game and are not interested in the AI model, just download the folder [Normal Snake](./Normal_Snake). 

On the other hand if you are only interested in the AI model, just download the folder [Snake AI](./Snake_AI). 

If you would like to have both feel free to download the whole repository. 

To run it you'll need to have python installed. You can install it in the [official python website](https://www.python.org/).

Once installed, to run **only** the game you must be inside the **Normal_Snake** folder and run this command in any terminal.

```powershell
python play.py
```

As well, to run **only** the AI game you must be inside the **Snake_AI** folder and run this command in any terminal.

```powershell
python playAI.py
```

# Snake Game

We are all familiar with the classic game "Snake", in which you control a little snake that gets bigger and bigger every time it eats. 

This is a version of the game 'Snake' made in python using the Pygame library. With this I'm also working on a deep learning AI model that will hopefully learn to play the game.

## Installation

To play the game we first need to download it.

If you would only like to play the game and are not interested in the AI model, just download the folder [Normal Snake](./Normal_Snake). 

On the other hand if you are only interested in the AI model, just download the folder [Snake AI](./Snake_AI). 

If you would like to have both feel free to download the whole repository.


To run it you'll need to have python installed. You can install it in the [official python website](https://www.python.org/).

It's important to point out that both the game and the AI require some dependencies to run. This are listed in the requirements text file inside each project. You can install this dependencies using this command.

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once installed, to run **only** the game you must be inside the **Normal_Snake** folder and run this command in any terminal.

```powershell
python play.py
```

As well, to run **only** the AI game you must be inside the **Snake_AI** folder and run this command in any terminal.

```powershell
python playAI.py
```
